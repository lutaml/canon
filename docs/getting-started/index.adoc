Welcome to Canon! This section will help you get up and running quickly.

== Overview

Canon is a Ruby library for canonicalization, pretty-printing, and semantic comparison of structured documents in multiple formats (XML, HTML, JSON, YAML).

Whether you're:

* A developer integrating Canon into an application
* A QA engineer writing tests for document generation
* A DevOps engineer comparing configuration files
* An architect evaluating Canon's design

This section provides everything you need to start using Canon effectively.

== What You'll Learn

This section covers:

link:installation[**Installation**]::
How to install Canon in your Ruby environment, including gem installation and bundler setup.

link:quick-start[**Quick Start**]::
Your first Canon operations - formatting and comparing documents with minimal code.

link:core-concepts[**Core Concepts**]::
Essential concepts to understand how Canon works: canonicalization, semantic comparison, and diff modes.

== Quick Example

Here's a taste of what Canon can do:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'canon'

# Format XML in canonical form
xml = '<root><b>2</b><a>1</a></root>'
canonical = Canon.format(xml, :xml, mode: :c14n)
# => "<root><a>1</a><b>2</b></root>"

# Compare documents semantically
doc1 = '<root><a>1</a><b>2</b></root>'
doc2 = '<root>  <b>2</b>  <a>1</a>  </root>'
Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2)
# => true (ignores whitespace and element order)
----

== Next Steps

After completing this section:

* Explore link:../interfaces/[Interfaces] to learn Ruby API, CLI, and RSpec usage
* Read link:../understanding/[Understanding Canon] to learn how it works internally
* Check link:../features/[Features] to customize Canon's behavior

== Common Questions

**Which Ruby versions are supported?**::
Canon supports Ruby 2.7 and higher.

**What formats does Canon support?**::
XML, HTML, JSON, and YAML. See link:../understanding/formats/[Format Support] for details.

**Can I use Canon without RSpec?**::
Yes! Canon works as a standalone library. RSpec matchers are optional.

**Is Canon suitable for production use?**::
Yes. The core DOM diff algorithm is stable and well-tested. The semantic tree diff is experimental.
