== Choose Your Interface

Canon provides three ways to work with document comparisons:

* **link:../interfaces/ruby-api/index.html[Ruby API]** - Using Canon from Ruby code
* **link:../interfaces/cli/index.html[Command-line Interface]** - Terminal commands and options
* **link:../interfaces/rspec/index.html[RSpec Matchers]** - Testing with Canon in RSpec

== Quick Examples

=== Ruby API

[source,ruby]
----
require 'canon'

# Compare two XML files
result = Canon.compare(
  File.read('expected.xml'),
  File.read('actual.xml'),
  format: :xml
)

puts result ? "✅ Equivalent" : "❌ Different"
----

=== Command Line

[source,bash]
----
# Compare two files (shows diff if they differ)
canon diff expected.xml actual.xml

# With detailed configuration info
canon diff expected.xml actual.xml --verbose

# With advanced options
canon diff expected.xml actual.xml \
  --diff-algorithm semantic \
  --match-profile strict \
  --verbose
----

=== RSpec

[source,ruby]
----
RSpec.describe "My XML" do
  it "matches expected output" do
    expect(actual_xml).to match_xml(expected_xml)
  end
end
----
