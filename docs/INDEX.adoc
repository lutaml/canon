[.lead]
Canon provides canonicalization, pretty-printing, and semantic comparison for XML, HTML, JSON, and YAML formats.

toc::[]

== Welcome

Canon helps you:

* **Format** documents into canonical or human-readable forms
* **Compare** documents semantically, not just textually
* **Test** with RSpec matchers that understand structure
* **Debug** with clear, color-coded diff output

== Quick Navigation

=== By Your Role

**Developer**::
Start with link:interfaces/ruby-api/[Ruby API] to integrate Canon into your applications.

**QA Engineer**::
Start with link:interfaces/rspec/[RSpec Matchers] for testing XML/JSON/YAML generation.

**DevOps**::
Start with link:interfaces/cli/[CLI] for command-line formatting and comparison.

**Architect**::
Start with link:understanding/architecture[Architecture] to understand Canon's design.

=== By Task

**Format a document**::
* link:getting-started/quick-start#formatting[Quick Start: Formatting]
* link:interfaces/ruby-api/formatting[Ruby API: Formatting]
* link:interfaces/cli/format-command[CLI: format command]

**Compare documents**::
* link:getting-started/quick-start#comparing[Quick Start: Comparing]
* link:interfaces/ruby-api/comparison[Ruby API: Comparison]
* link:interfaces/cli/diff-command[CLI: diff command]

**Test XML generation**::
* link:guides/testing-xml-generation[Guide: Testing XML Generation]
* link:interfaces/rspec/matchers[RSpec Matchers]

**Debug test failures**::
* link:guides/debugging-test-failures[Guide: Debugging Test Failures]
* link:features/diff-formatting/character-visualization[Character Visualization]

=== By Format

link:understanding/formats/xml[**XML**]::
W3C Canonical XML 1.1, namespace handling, attribute ordering

link:understanding/formats/html[**HTML**]::
HTML4/5 detection, rendered whitespace handling

link:understanding/formats/json[**JSON**]::
Sorted keys, semantic comparison

link:understanding/formats/yaml[**YAML**]::
Sorted keys, alias handling
