comparison flow

== Level 4: Customizing behavior

Configure Canon for your specific needs:

* **link:MATCH_OPTIONS[Match options]** - Match dimensions and profiles
* **link:PREPROCESSING[Preprocessing]** - Document normalization options
* **link:DIFF_FORMATTING[Diff formatting]** - Customizing diff output
* **link:INPUT_VALIDATION[Input validation]** - Error handling
* **link:CHARACTER_VISUALIZATION[Character visualization]** - Whitespace
visibility

== Level 5: Advanced topics

For developers and advanced users:

* **link:VERBOSE[Verbose mode]** - Two-tier diff output architecture
* **link:SEMANTIC_DIFF_REPORT[Semantic diff report]** - Detailed report
format
* **link:NORMATIVE_INFORMATIVE_DIFFS[Normative vs informative diffs]** - Diff
classification

== Contributing to documentation

=== Documentation style guidelines

When updating Canon documentation, follow these principles:

**Heading style**::
* Use sentence-case for all headings (e.g., "Match architecture", not "Match
Architecture")
* Use descriptive, clear headings that indicate content scope

**Structure**::
* Begin with a Scope section explaining what the document covers
* Include a General section for background and key concepts
* Organize content into logical sections with clear hierarchy
* Use "See also" section at the end for cross-references

**MECE principle**::
* **Mutually Exclusive**: Each document covers a distinct topic without
overlap
* **Collectively Exhaustive**: All topics covered without gaps
* Avoid duplicate information across documents

**Examples and code**::
* Wrap examples with `[example]` and `====` delimiters
* Use `[source,lang]` with `----` delimiters for code blocks
* Provide clear example titles describing what is shown
* Include explanation after code examples
* Use practical, real-world examples when possible

**Lists**::
* Separate lists from surrounding content with blank lines before and after
* Ordered lists: Use `. ` flush with the line beginning
* Unordered lists: Use `* ` flush with the line beginning
* Second-level ordered: Use `.. `
* Second-level unordered: Use `** `
* Definition lists: Use `term:: description` format

**Line length and formatting**::
* Wrap lines at 80 characters
* Exceptions: Cross-references, formulas, and code blocks
* No "hanging paragraphs" - if needed, create a "General" subsection

**Cross-references**::
* Link to related documents using `link:DOCUMENT[Link text]`
* Include "See also" section listing related documentation
* Reference specific sections using anchors where appropriate

**File organization**::
* Each file uses `:toc:` and `:toclevels: 3` for navigation
* Keep files focused on a single topic
* Aim for 200-500 lines per document (except comprehensive references)

=== Content guidelines

**Clarity**::
* Write in clear, technical prose
* Define terms when first introduced
* Use consistent terminology throughout

**Completeness**::
* Provide complete syntax definitions
* Include "Where," legend explaining syntax elements
* Show both basic and advanced usage

**Accuracy**::
* Verify all code examples work correctly
* Ensure cross-references point to existing documents
* Keep documentation synchronized with code changes

**Accessibility**::
* Write for users with varying expertise levels
* Progress from simple to complex topics
* Link to prerequisite knowledge
