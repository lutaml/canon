Task-oriented tutorials for common Canon use cases.

== Overview

This section provides step-by-step guides for accomplishing specific tasks with Canon. Each guide walks you through a complete workflow from start to finish.

Unlike reference documentation that explains individual features, these guides show you how to combine features to solve real problems.

== By Use Case

=== Testing and QA

**Writing reliable XML tests**::
link:testing-xml-generation[Testing XML Generation] shows how to use Canon's RSpec matchers for robust testing.

**Debugging test failures**::
link:debugging-test-failures[Debugging Test Failures] provides systematic troubleshooting strategies.

**Comparing configuration files**::
Use link:../features/match-options/profiles[Match Profiles] with the `spec_friendly` profile.

=== Migration and Integration

**Switching from another tool**::
link:migrating-from-xmldiff[Migrating from XMLDiff] helps you transition smoothly.

**Integrating into CI/CD**::
See link:../interfaces/cli/[CLI Reference] for command-line usage in pipelines.

**Adding to existing test suite**::
link:testing-xml-generation[Testing XML Generation] covers integration patterns.

=== Performance and Scale

**Handling large files**::
link:performance-optimization[Performance Optimization] shows strategies for large documents.

**Batch processing**::
See link:performance-optimization#batch-processing[Batch Processing] section.

**Optimizing comparison speed**::
link:performance-optimization#algorithm-selection[Algorithm Selection] explains trade-offs.

=== Customization and Extension

**Custom comparison logic**::
link:custom-comparators[Building Custom Comparators] walks through the process.

**Format-specific handling**::
See link:../advanced/extending-canon[Extending Canon] for adapter development.

== Guide Structure

Each guide follows this structure:

**Overview**::
What you'll learn and prerequisites.

**Problem**::
The real-world problem this guide solves.

**Solution**::
Step-by-step walkthrough with code examples.

**Explanation**::
Why the solution works and alternatives to consider.

**Summary**::
Key takeaways and next steps.

== Prerequisites

Most guides assume:

* Ruby 2.7 or higher installed
* Basic familiarity with Canon concepts
* Understanding of the format you're working with

If you're new to Canon, start with link:../getting-started/[Getting Started] first.

== Common Patterns

=== Test-Friendly Comparison

[source,ruby]
----
# Ignore formatting differences in tests
expect(actual_xml).to be_xml_equivalent_to(expected_xml,
  match_profile: :spec_friendly
)
----

See link:testing-xml-generation#test-friendly-matching[Test-Friendly Matching].

=== Detailed Debugging

[source,ruby]
----
# Get detailed diff output
result = Canon::Comparison.compare(expected, actual,
  verbose: true,
  visualize_whitespace: true,
  context_lines: 10
)
puts result.diff
----

See link:debugging-test-failures#verbose-output[Verbose Output].

=== Performance Tuning

[source,ruby]
----
# Optimize for large files
Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  preprocessing: :none,  # Skip preprocessing
  diff_algorithm: :dom,  # Use faster algorithm
  max_nodes: 50000       # Increase limit if needed
)
----

See link:performance-optimization#tuning-options[Tuning Options].
