== Purpose

Canon uses a consistent color scheme and symbol system to make diff output easy to read and understand at a glance. Colors and symbols distinguish between different types of changes and provide immediate visual feedback about the nature of differences.

== Color Scheme

Canon uses ANSI terminal colors to highlight different aspects of diffs:

=== Primary Diff Colors

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
|Color |Usage |Meaning

|Red
|Deletions, removed content
|Lines or elements that exist in the expected/first file but are missing in the actual/second file

|Green
|Additions, added content
|Lines or elements that exist in the actual/second file but are missing in the expected/first file

|Yellow
|Modified content, changes
|Content that exists in both files but with different values

|Cyan
|Headers, structural information
|Section headers, file names, metadata
|===

=== Normative vs Informative Colors

Canon classifies diffs as either **normative** (affect equivalence) or **informative** (don't affect equivalence based on match options):

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
|Classification |Color |Meaning

|Normative
|Red/Green
|Differences that cause files to be non-equivalent based on current match options

|Informative
|Cyan (with different markers)
|Differences that are ignored by current match options but shown for informational purposes
|===

.Example: Informative diff with strict whitespace matching off
[example]
====
[source]
----
# With text_content: :normalize (default)
# Whitespace differences are informative

  5| ~~ | <p>Hello world</p>       # Original
    | ~~ | <p>Hello  world</p>      # Extra space (cyan, informative)
----

The cyan color indicates this difference is informative - it won't cause equivalence to fail because `text_content: :normalize` ignores extra whitespace.
====

== Symbol System

=== Line-by-Line Diff Symbols

In by-line diff mode, symbols at the start of each line indicate the type of change:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Symbol |Color |Meaning

|`-`
|Red
|Deleted line (exists in expected, not in actual)

|`+`
|Green
|Added line (exists in actual, not in expected)

|`~`
|Yellow
|Modified line (exists in both but content differs)

|`~~`
|Cyan
|Informative change (doesn't affect equivalence)

|(no symbol)
|Default
|Context line (unchanged)
|===

.Example: Line symbols in action
[example]
====
[source]
----
   3|    | <root>                   # Context (unchanged)
   4|   -| <item>Old</item>         # Deleted (red)
     |  5+| <item>New</item>         # Added (green)
   5|  6 | </root>                  # Context (unchanged)
----
====

=== Tree Diff Symbols

In by-object diff mode, box-drawing characters create a visual tree structure:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Symbol |Meaning

|`├──`
|Tree branch (child element)

|`└──`
|Last tree branch (last child)

|`│`
|Tree continuation (vertical line)

|`-`
|Deletion marker (red)

|`+`
|Addition marker (green)

|`~`
|Change marker (yellow)
|===

.Example: Tree structure with symbols
[example]
====
[source]
----
root
├── - item: "Old value"              # Deleted (red -)
├── + item: "New value"               # Added (green +)
└── ~ title                           # Modified (yellow ~)
    ├── - "Old Title"                 # Old value
    └── + "New Title"                 # New value
----
====

== Character Visualization Symbols

When `use_color: true`, Canon visualizes invisible characters using Unicode symbols. See link:character-visualization.html[Character Visualization] for the complete mapping.

Common examples:

[cols="2,1,2"]
|===
|Character |Symbol |Unicode

|Regular space
|`░`
|U+2591 (Light Shade)

|Tab
|`⇥`
|U+21E5 (Rightwards Arrow to Bar)

|Non-breaking space
|`␣`
|U+2423 (Open Box)

|Line feed
|`↵`
|U+21B5 (Downwards Arrow with Corner Leftwards)

|Zero-width space
|`→`
|U+2192 (Rightwards Arrow)
|===

== Header and Metadata Colors

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
|Element |Color |Purpose

|Section headers
|Cyan + Bold
|"Visual Diff:", "Line-by-line diff:", etc.

|Algorithm name
|Cyan + Bold
|"Algorithm: SEMANTIC TREE DIFF", "Algorithm: DOM DIFF"

|Success messages
|Green + Bold
|"✅ Files are semantically equivalent"

|Separators
|Cyan + Bold
|"━━━━" (Unicode box drawing)

|Legend headers
|Cyan + Bold
|"Character Visualization Legend:"

|Category names
|Yellow + Bold
|"Common Whitespace:", "Unicode Spaces:", etc.
|===

== Normative vs Informative Classification

The color distinction between normative and informative diffs is crucial:

=== Normative Diffs (Red/Green)

**Definition**: Differences that cause files to be non-equivalent based on the current match configuration.

**When shown**:
* Match dimension is set to `:strict` or `:normalize`
* The difference persists even after applying normalization

.Example: Normative attribute difference
[example]
====
[source]
----
# With attribute_order: :strict
   5|   -| <item id="a" name="foo"/>    # Red (normative)
     |  6+| <item name="foo" id="a"/>    # Green (normative)
----

The attribute order difference is normative because `attribute_order: :strict` treats it as significant.
====

=== Informative Diffs (Cyan)

**Definition**: Differences that don't affect file equivalence based on the current match configuration.

**When shown**:
* Match dimension is set to `:ignore` or `:normalize` handled the difference
* The difference exists but is ignored for equivalence purposes
* Shown with `show_diffs: :all` or `show_diffs: :informative`

.Example: Informative whitespace difference
[example]
====
[source]
----
# With structural_whitespace: :ignore
   5| ~~ | <item>                       # Cyan (informative)
     | ~~ |   <name>Widget</name>        # Extra indentation ignored
----

The whitespace difference is informative because `structural_whitespace: :ignore` means it doesn't affect equivalence.
====

== Color Control

=== Enabling/Disabling Colors

Colors are controlled by the `use_color` option:

.CLI
[example]
====
[source,bash]
----
# Enable colors (default)
canon diff file1.xml file2.xml --color

# Disable colors
canon diff file1.xml file2.xml --no-color
----
====

.Ruby API
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
# Enable colors
Canon.compare(file1, file2, format: :xml, color: true)

# Disable colors
Canon.compare(file1, file2, format: :xml, color: false)
----
====

.RSpec
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # Enable for local, disable for CI
  config.canon.xml.diff.use_color = !ENV['CI']
end
----
====

=== Environment Variable

[source,bash]
----
# Disable colors globally
export CANON_USE_COLOR=false

# Enable colors globally
export CANON_USE_COLOR=true
----

== Terminal Compatibility

=== ANSI Support

Canon's color output requires terminal ANSI escape sequence support:

**Compatible terminals**:
* macOS Terminal
* iTerm2
* GNOME Terminal
* Konsole
* Windows Terminal
* VS Code integrated terminal

**Limited support**:
* Windows CMD (requires Windows 10 or later)
* Basic terminal emulators

=== Unicode Support

The symbol system requires Unicode (UTF-8) support:

**Requirements**:
* Terminal encoding set to UTF-8
* Font with Unicode glyph support
* Terminal that renders box-drawing characters

**Recommended fonts**:
* Menlo, Monaco (macOS)
* Consolas (Windows)
* DejaVu Sans Mono (Linux)
* Any "Nerd Font" variant

== Diff Type Display Options

Control which types of diffs to show using the `show_diffs` option:

[cols="2,3"]
|===
|Option |What's Shown

|`:all` (default)
|Both normative and informative diffs

|`:normative`
|Only normative diffs (red/green)

|`:informative`
|Only informative diffs (cyan)
|===

.Example: Show only normative diffs
[example]
====
[source,bash]
----
# CLI - only show differences that affect equivalence
canon diff file1.xml file2.xml --show-diffs normative
----

[source,ruby]
----
# Ruby API
Canon.compare(file1, file2,
  format: :xml,
  show_diffs: :normative
)
----
====

== Colorblind-Friendly Features

While Canon uses colors, it also provides symbols that work without color:

* **Symbols** (`-`, `+`, `~`) distinguish change types
* **Line numbers** show correspondence
* **Tree structure** shows hierarchy
* **Text labels** describe differences

The combination ensures diffs are readable even without color perception.
