== Common Lookups

=== CLI Command Structure

[source,bash]
----
# Format command
canon format <file> [options]

# Diff command
canon diff <file1> <file2> [options]
----

See link:cli-options[CLI Options Reference] for all options.

=== Ruby API Patterns

[source,ruby]
----
# Formatting
Canon.format(input, format, **options)

# Comparison
Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2, **options)
Canon::Comparison.compare(doc1, doc2, **options)

# RSpec matchers
expect(actual).to be_xml_equivalent_to(expected)
expect(actual).to match_xml(expected, **options)
----

See link:ruby-api-methods[Ruby API Reference] for complete signatures.

=== Environment Variables

[source,bash]
----
# Size limits
export CANON_MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880  # 5MB
export CANON_MAX_NODES=10000

# Diff configuration
export CANON_DIFF_CONTEXT_LINES=5
export CANON_DIFF_GROUPING_LINES=3

# Debug
export CANON_DEBUG=true
----

See link:environment-variables[Environment Variables Reference] for all variables.
