= Semantic tree diff
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

[WARNING]
The semantic tree diff feature is currently **experimental** and under active
development. While it is functional and tested, the API and behavior may change
in future releases. Use with caution in production environments.

== General

Canon provides two complementary diff modes:

* **DOM diff** (default): Line-based comparison that matches elements by
  position and structure
* **Semantic tree diff** (opt-in): Operation-based comparison that detects
  high-level edit operations (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, MOVE, MERGE, SPLIT,
  UPGRADE, DOWNGRADE)

The semantic tree diff is based on research in XML diff algorithms (XDiff 2002,
XyDiff/Cobena 2002, JATS-diff 2022) and provides operation-level analysis of
changes between document trees.

== Purpose

The semantic tree diff enables:

* **Operation detection**: Identify INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, MOVE, MERGE, SPLIT,
  UPGRADE, and DOWNGRADE operations
* **Intelligent matching**: Match similar nodes even when positions change
* **Format independence**: Works with XML, JSON, HTML, and YAML
* **Statistical analysis**: Provides matching statistics and confidence scores

Use semantic tree diff when you need to:

* Understand what operations transformed one document into another
* Track content that moved between positions
* Analyze structural changes at a high level
* Compare documents with significant rearrangement

== Enabling semantic tree diff

Enable semantic tree diff by setting `diff_algorithm: :semantic`:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'canon/comparison'

result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic
)
----

The system will use tree diff instead of the default DOM diff. Both modes
cannot be used simultaneously.

== Detected operations

The semantic tree diff detects these eight operations in three levels:

* **Level 1**: Basic operations (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE)
* **Level 2**: Structural operations (MOVE)
* **Level 3**: Semantic operations (MERGE, SPLIT, UPGRADE, DOWNGRADE)

=== Detection algorithms

The operation detector uses a pattern-based approach inspired by XDiff, XyDiff,
and JATS-diff research:

**Level 1 - Basic operations:**

* **INSERT**: Detected by finding nodes in tree2 with no match in tree1
* **DELETE**: Detected by finding nodes in tree1 with no match in tree2
* **UPDATE**: Detected when matched nodes have different content, attributes, or labels

**Level 2 - Structural operations:**

* **MOVE**: Detected when a matched node has a different parent in tree2 than
  its matched parent from tree1

**Level 3 - Semantic operations:**

These are detected by analyzing patterns in the basic operations:

* **MERGE**: Pattern of (n-1) DELETE operations + 1 UPDATE operation where
  deleted content appears in the updated node (80% text similarity threshold)

* **SPLIT**: Pattern of 1 DELETE operation + n INSERT operations where the
  deleted node's content is distributed across the inserted nodes (80% text
  similarity threshold)

* **UPGRADE**: Pattern of DELETE + INSERT where the inserted node is at a
  shallower depth (promoted in hierarchy) with same label and similar content
  (90% similarity threshold)

* **DOWNGRADE**: Pattern of DELETE + INSERT where the inserted node is at a
  deeper depth (demoted in hierarchy) with same label and similar content (90%
  similarity threshold)

When semantic operations are detected, the component basic operations are
removed and replaced with the higher-level semantic operation.

=== Operation types

=== INSERT

A new node was added to the tree.

[example]
====
.Before
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <a>1</a>
</root>
----

.After
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <a>1</a>
  <b>2</b>
</root>
----

Operation: INSERT `<b>2</b>`
====

=== DELETE

A node was removed from the tree.

[example]
====
.Before
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <a>1</a>
  <b>2</b>
</root>
----

.After
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <a>1</a>
</root>
----

Operation: DELETE `<b>2</b>`
====

=== UPDATE

A node's content or attributes changed.

[example]
====
.Before
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <a id="1">old text</a>
</root>
----

.After
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <a id="2">new text</a>
</root>
----

Operation: UPDATE `<a>` (id and text changed)
====

=== MOVE

A node was relocated to a different position in the tree.

[example]
====
.Before
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <section1>
    <item>X</item>
  </section1>
  <section2>
  </section2>
</root>
----

.After
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <section1>
  </section1>
  <section2>
    <item>X</item>
  </section2>
</root>
----

Operation: MOVE `<item>X</item>` from section1 to section2
====

=== MERGE

Multiple nodes were combined into a single node.

[example]
====
.Before
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <paragraph>First sentence.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Second sentence.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Third sentence.</paragraph>
</root>
----

.After
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <paragraph>First sentence. Second sentence. Third sentence.</paragraph>
</root>
----

Operation: MERGE 3 `<paragraph>` nodes into one
====

=== SPLIT

A single node was divided into multiple nodes.

[example]
====
.Before
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <section>
    <title>Combined Content</title>
    <paragraph>First part. Second part.</paragraph>
  </section>
</root>
----

.After
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <section>
    <title>First Content</title>
    <paragraph>First part.</paragraph>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Second Content</title>
    <paragraph>Second part.</paragraph>
  </section>
</root>
----

Operation: SPLIT 1 `<section>` into 2 sections
====

=== UPGRADE

A node was promoted to a higher level in the hierarchy (decreased depth).

[example]
====
.Before
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <chapter>
    <section>
      <subsection>
        <title>Important Topic</title>
        <content>This is important.</content>
      </subsection>
    </section>
  </chapter>
</root>
----

.After
[source,xml]
----
<root>
  <chapter>
    <section>
      <title>Important Topic</title>
      <content>This is important.</content>
    </section>
  </chapter>
</root>
----

Operation: UPGRADE `<subsection>` promoted to `<section>` level
====

=== DOWNGRADE

A node was demoted to a lower level in the hierarchy (increased depth).

[example]
====
.Before
[source,json]
----
{
  "items": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Item A", "type": "primary" }
  ]
}
----

.After
[source,json]
----
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "details": {
        "name": "Item A",
        "type": "primary"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Operation: DOWNGRADE `name` and `type` demoted into nested `details` object
====

== Matching algorithm

The semantic tree diff uses a hybrid three-phase matching pipeline:

=== Phase 1: Hash-based exact matching

Matches nodes with identical structure and content using hash signatures.

* Fast O(n) exact matching
* Eliminates unchanged subtrees
* Reduces problem size for subsequent phases

=== Phase 2: Similarity-based matching

Matches similar but not identical nodes using similarity scoring.

* Compares node names, attributes, text content, and structure
* Configurable similarity threshold (default: 0.95)
* Uses weighted similarity metrics

=== Phase 3: Structural propagation

Propagates matches from parents and children to improve matching quality.

* Top-down propagation from matched parents
* Bottom-up propagation from matched children
* Resolves ambiguous matches

== Configuration options

=== similarity_threshold

Controls the minimum similarity score for matching nodes.

[source,ruby]
----
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  match: {
    similarity_threshold: 0.90  # Default: 0.95
  }
)
----

Where,

* Higher values (e.g., 0.99): More conservative, only very similar nodes match
* Lower values (e.g., 0.80): More aggressive, allows less similar nodes to match
* Default 0.95: Balanced approach suitable for most use cases

=== hash_matching

Enable or disable hash-based exact matching phase.

[source,ruby]
----
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  match: {
    hash_matching: true  # Default: true
  }
)
----

Disable only if exact matching causes issues with your data.

=== similarity_matching

Enable or disable similarity-based matching phase.

[source,ruby]
----
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  match: {
    similarity_matching: true  # Default: true
  }
)
----

Disable for faster but less accurate matching.

=== propagation

Enable or disable structural propagation phase.

[source,ruby]
----
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  match: {
    propagation: true  # Default: true
  }
)
----

Disable for simpler but potentially less accurate results.

== Result format

When `verbose: true` is set, the result includes operation details:

[source,ruby]
----
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic
)

# Access operations
result.operations.each do |op|
  puts "#{op.type}: #{op.node1_path} -> #{op.node2_path}"
end

# Access matching statistics
stats = result.match_options[:tree_diff_statistics]
puts "Total nodes tree1: #{stats[:tree1_node_count]}"
puts "Total nodes tree2: #{stats[:tree2_node_count]}"
puts "Matched nodes: #{stats[:matched_count]}"
puts "Match rate: #{stats[:match_rate]}"

# Access matching details
matching = result.match_options[:tree_diff_matching]
matching.each_pair do |node1, node2|
  puts "Matched: #{node1.path} <-> #{node2.path}"
end
----

== Examples

=== Basic comparison with operations

[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
require 'canon/comparison'

xml1 = <<~XML
  <article>
    <title>Old Title</title>
    <section id="1">
      <p>Content A</p>
    </section>
  </article>
XML

xml2 = <<~XML
  <article>
    <title>New Title</title>
    <section id="2">
      <p>Content B</p>
    </section>
    <section id="1">
      <p>Content A</p>
    </section>
  </article>
XML

result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(xml1, xml2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic
)

result.operations.each do |op|
  case op.type
  when :insert
    puts "Added: #{op.node2.name} at #{op.node2_path}"
  when :update
    puts "Changed: #{op.node1_path}"
  when :move
    puts "Moved: #{op.node1_path} -> #{op.node2_path}"
  end
end
----

Output:
```
Changed: /article/title
Added: section at /article/section[1]
```
====

=== Detecting moves

[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
json1 = <<~JSON
  {
    "sections": [
      { "id": "intro", "content": "Introduction text" },
      { "id": "body", "content": "Body text" }
    ]
  }
JSON

json2 = <<~JSON
  {
    "sections": [
      { "id": "body", "content": "Body text" },
      { "id": "intro", "content": "Introduction text" }
    ]
  }
JSON

result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(json1, json2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic
)

moves = result.operations.select { |op| op.type == :move }
puts "Detected #{moves.size} move operations"
----
====

=== Adjusting similarity threshold

[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
# Strict matching - only very similar nodes match
result_strict = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  match: {
    similarity_threshold: 0.99
  }
)

# Lenient matching - allow more variation
result_lenient = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  match: {
    similarity_threshold: 0.85
  }
)

puts "Strict: #{result_strict.operations.size} operations"
puts "Lenient: #{result_lenient.operations.size} operations"
----
====

== Format support

Semantic tree diff works with all Canon-supported formats:

=== XML

Full support including namespaces, attributes, and mixed content.

[source,ruby]
----
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(xml1, xml2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic
)
----

=== JSON

Supports objects, arrays, and primitive values.

[source,ruby]
----
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(json1, json2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic
)
----

=== HTML

Handles HTML 4/5 and XHTML documents.

[source,ruby]
----
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(html1, html2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic
)
----

=== YAML

Processes YAML documents with nested structures.

[source,ruby]
----
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(yaml1, yaml2,
  verbose: true,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic
)
----

== Interaction with other options

=== Preprocessing

Preprocessing applies before tree diff:

[source,ruby]
----
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  verbose: true,
  preprocessing: :c14n,  # Applied first
  diff_algorithm: :semantic
)
----

The preprocessing option normalizes documents before tree diff runs, ensuring
consistent comparison.

=== Match dimensions

Match dimensions DO apply with semantic diff and control whether detected
operations are classified as **normative** (must-fix) or **informative**
(can-ignore) differences.

When a match dimension is set to `:ignore`, operations related to that
dimension are marked as informative. When set to `:strict` or `:normalize`,
they are marked as normative.

==== Dimension mapping to operations

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Match Dimension |Operation Types |Effect when `:ignore`

|`text_content`
|UPDATE (text changes)
|Text content changes → informative

|`attribute_values`
|UPDATE (attribute changes)
|Attribute value changes → informative

|`attribute_order`
|UPDATE (attribute reordering)
|Attribute order changes → informative

|`element_hierarchy`
|UPGRADE, DOWNGRADE
|Hierarchy depth changes → informative

|`element_position`
|MOVE
|Element position changes → informative

|`element_hierarchy`
|MOVE (between parents)
|Hierarchy changes → informative

|`comments`
|UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE (comments)
|Comment changes → informative

|`structural_whitespace`
|UPDATE (whitespace)
|Whitespace changes → informative
|===

==== Examples

.Ignoring text content changes
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
# Text UPDATE operations are marked as informative
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  verbose: true,
  match: {
    text_content: :ignore  # Text changes → informative
  }
)

# Check if there are any normative (structural) differences
has_normative = result.differences.any?(&:normative?)
----
====

.Ignoring element position changes
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
# MOVE operations are marked as informative
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  verbose: true,
  match: {
    element_position: :ignore  # Moves → informative
  }
)

# Only structural changes are normative
normative_ops = result.differences.select(&:normative?)
puts "Normative changes: #{normative_ops.map(&:dimension).uniq}"
----
====

.Combining multiple dimension settings
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
# Complex filtering: care about structure but not formatting
result = Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  verbose: true,
  match: {
    # Normative dimensions (must match)
    element_structure: :strict,
    element_hierarchy: :strict,

    # Informative dimensions (can differ)
    text_content: :ignore,
    attribute_order: :ignore,
    structural_whitespace: :ignore,
    comments: :ignore
  }
)

# Report only normative differences
if result.differences.any?(&:normative?)
  puts "Structural differences found!"
  result.differences.select(&:normative?).each do |diff|
    puts "  #{diff.dimension}: #{diff.reason}"
  end
end
----
====

==== Semantic-specific dimensions

The three semantic-specific dimensions are only meaningful with semantic diff:

* `element_hierarchy`: Controls UPGRADE/DOWNGRADE operations (depth changes)
* `element_position`: Controls MOVE operations (position changes)
* `element_hierarchy`: Controls MOVE operations (parent changes)

With DOM diff, these dimensions have no effect since DOM diff doesn't detect
these operation types.

== Performance considerations

=== Time complexity

* Hash matching: O(n) where n is node count
* Similarity matching: O(n²) worst case, O(n log n) typical
* Propagation: O(n)

For large documents (>10,000 nodes), consider:

* Disabling similarity_matching if exact matches suffice
* Increasing similarity_threshold to reduce candidate matches
* Using preprocessing to reduce document size

=== Memory usage

The tree diff maintains:

* Full tree representations of both documents
* Hash signatures for all nodes
* Matching state and operations

For very large documents, monitor memory usage and consider processing in
chunks if needed.

== Troubleshooting

=== Too many/too few matches

Adjust `similarity_threshold`:

[source,ruby]
----
# Too many false matches? Increase threshold
Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  match: { similarity_threshold: 0.98 }
)

# Too few matches? Decrease threshold
Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  match: { similarity_threshold: 0.90 }
)
----

=== Incorrect move detection

Moves are detected when nodes match but positions change. If move detection is
incorrect:

* Verify nodes are truly similar (check attributes and content)
* Adjust similarity_threshold
* Check if preprocessing is needed to normalize content

=== Performance issues

For slow comparisons:

[source,ruby]
----
# Disable expensive phases
Canon::Comparison.equivalent?(doc1, doc2,
  diff_algorithm: :semantic,
  match: {
    similarity_matching: false,  # Skip if exact matches suffice
    propagation: false            # Skip if not needed
  }
)
----

== Metadata Element Classification

Metadata elements are presentation/formatting elements that don't affect semantic equivalence. The semantic tree diff automatically classifies operations on these elements as **informative** (non-normative).

=== Metadata Elements

The following elements are treated as metadata:

* `semx` - Semantic markup
* `fmt-concept` - Formatted concept
* `fmt-name` - Formatted name
* `fmt-title` - Formatted title
* `fmt-xref` - Formatted cross-reference
* `fmt-eref` - Formatted external reference
* `fmt-termref` - Formatted term reference
* `fmt-element-name` - Formatted element name
* `fmt-link` - Formatted link
* `autonum` - Automatic numbering

=== Classification Rules

When an operation involves a metadata element:

* **INSERT of metadata element**: Marked as informative
* **DELETE of metadata element**: Marked as informative
* **UPDATE of metadata element**: Marked as informative
* **MOVE of metadata element**: Marked as informative

This ensures that presentation-layer changes don't cause false positives in semantic comparison.

.Example: Metadata element changes are informative
[example]
====
[source,xml]
----
<!-- Document 1 -->
<section>
  <title>Introduction</title>
  <autonum>1.1</autonum>
</section>

<!-- Document 2 -->
<section>
  <title>Introduction</title>
  <autonum>1.2</autonum>  <!-- Changed -->
  <semx element="title">Introduction</semx>  <!-- Added -->
</section>
----

Operations detected:

* UPDATE `<autonum>` (1.1 → 1.2): **Informative** (metadata element)
* INSERT `<semx>`: **Informative** (metadata element)

The documents are considered semantically equivalent despite these presentation changes.
====

=== Configuring Metadata Elements

The metadata element list is defined in [`OperationConverter::METADATA_ELEMENTS`](../lib/canon/tree_diff/operation_converter.rb:33).

To treat additional elements as metadata, modify the `METADATA_ELEMENTS` constant. Alternatively, use match dimensions to ignore specific changes.

== Whitespace-Sensitive Elements

Certain elements preserve whitespace as semantically significant. For these elements, whitespace is **not normalized** even when `text_content: :normalize` is set.

=== Whitespace-Sensitive Element List

* `pre` - Preformatted text
* `code` - Code blocks
* `textarea` - Text input areas
* `script` - JavaScript code
* `style` - CSS styles

=== Whitespace Handling

For whitespace-sensitive elements:

* Text content is preserved exactly as-is during tree conversion
* Normalization does NOT apply to text content
* Whitespace differences are **normative** (must match exactly)
* Leading/trailing spaces are significant

.Example: Whitespace in `<pre>` is significant
[example]
====
[source,html]
----
<!-- Document 1 -->
<pre>
  Line 1
  Line 2
</pre>

<!-- Document 2 -->
<pre>
Line 1
Line 2
</pre>
----

Operation detected:

* UPDATE `<pre>` text content: **Normative** (whitespace differs)

These documents are NOT equivalent because `<pre>` preserves whitespace. The leading spaces in Document 1 are semantically significant.
====

.Example: Whitespace in `<p>` is normalized
[example]
====
[source,html]
----
<!-- Document 1 -->
<p>
  Line 1
  Line 2
</p>

<!-- Document 2 -->
<p>
Line 1
Line 2
</p>
----

With `text_content: :normalize`:

* No UPDATE detected (whitespace normalized in `<p>`)

These documents ARE equivalent because `<p>` normalizes whitespace when `text_content: :normalize` is set.
====

=== Implementation

Whitespace-sensitive elements are detected automatically based on element name in the format adapters:

* [`XMLAdapter`](../lib/canon/tree_diff/adapters/xml_adapter.rb) - Preserves original text
* [`HTMLAdapter`](../lib/canon/tree_diff/adapters/html_adapter.rb) - Preserves original text

The normalization decision happens in [`OperationDetector`](../lib/canon/tree_diff/operations/operation_detector.rb) based on element name and match options.

== Comparison with DOM diff

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Aspect |DOM diff (default) |Semantic tree diff

|Matching
|Position-based with DOM structure
|Similarity-based with tree operations

|Operations
|Line-by-line changes
|INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, MOVE, MERGE, SPLIT, UPGRADE, DOWNGRADE

|Use case
|Traditional diff output
|Operation-level analysis

|Performance
|Faster for large docs
|Slower but more intelligent

|Move detection
|No
|Yes

|Rearrangement
|Shows as delete + insert
|Shows as MOVE

|Format support
|XML, HTML, JSON, YAML
|XML, HTML, JSON, YAML

|Output mode
|Line-based or tree-based
|Operation list

|Verbose mode
|Required for detailed output
|Required for operations
|===

Both modes are first-class citizens in Canon. Choose based on your needs:

* Use **DOM diff** for traditional comparison and readable output
* Use **tree diff** for operation analysis and move detection

== Research background

The semantic tree diff implementation is based on:

* **XDiff (2002)**: Minimum-cost edit distance with unordered tree model
* **XyDiff/Cobena (2002)**: BULD algorithm with hash signatures and weights
* **JATS-diff (2022)**: Semantic operations for text-centric XML

Key innovations in Canon's implementation:

* Hybrid matching pipeline combining hash, similarity, and propagation
* Format adapters for XML, JSON, HTML, YAML
* Integration with Canon's existing comparison architecture
* Configurable similarity thresholds and matching phases

See `xmldiff-resources.md` in the repository for research paper details.
