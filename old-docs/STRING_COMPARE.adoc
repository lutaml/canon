= String Comparison in Canon
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== General

Canon provides advanced string comparison capabilities with character-level visualization and diff rendering. This feature is particularly useful for:

* Comparing strings with invisible whitespace differences (spaces, tabs, trailing newlines)
* Detecting Unicode differences (non-breaking spaces, zero-width characters, etc.)
* Visualizing multi-line string differences with context
* Identifying trailing newline differences in text output

== Character Visualization

Canon automatically visualizes invisible and special characters to make differences clear:

[cols="2,3,2",options="header"]
|===
|Character
|Description
|Visualization

|Space (U+0020)
|Regular space
|`░`

|Tab (U+0009)
|Tab character
|`⇥`

|Non-breaking space (U+00A0)
|Non-breaking space
|`␣`

|Zero-width space (U+200B)
|Zero-width space
|`→`

|Other invisible characters
|Various Unicode invisibles
|See Unicode legend in output
|===

== Usage in RSpec

=== Auto-detection with `be_equivalent_to`

The `be_equivalent_to` matcher automatically detects the format (XML, JSON, YAML, or string) and uses the appropriate comparison mode.

.Auto-detecting string mode
[source,ruby]
----
RSpec.describe "String comparison" do
  it "auto-detects string format" do
    actual = "Hello World"
    expected = "Hello Universe"

    expect(actual).to be_equivalent_to(expected)
    # Automatically uses STRING mode for plain text
  end
end
----

=== Explicit string mode with `be_string_equivalent_to`

For explicit string comparison, use the `be_string_equivalent_to` matcher.

.Basic string comparison
[source,ruby]
----
RSpec.describe "String comparison" do
  it "compares strings exactly" do
    expect("Hello World").to be_string_equivalent_to("Hello World")
  end

  it "detects differences" do
    expect("Hello World").not_to be_string_equivalent_to("Hello Universe")
  end
end
----

=== Whitespace differences

.Detecting extra spaces
[source,ruby]
----
it "detects extra spaces" do
  actual = "Hello World"
  expected = "Hello  World"  # Two spaces

  expect(actual).not_to be_string_equivalent_to(expected)
end
----

When this test fails, the output shows:

----
expected STRING to be equivalent

Line-by-line diff (STRING mode):
   1|   1- | Hello░World
    |   1+ | Hello░░World
----

=== Trailing newline differences

.Detecting trailing newlines
[source,ruby]
----
it "detects trailing newline" do
  actual = "data:image/png;base64,abc123"
  expected = "data:image/png;base64,abc123\n"

  expect(actual).not_to be_string_equivalent_to(expected)
end
----

When this test fails, the output shows two separate lines:

----
expected STRING to be equivalent

Line-by-line diff (STRING mode):
   1|   1  | data:image/png;base64,abc123
    |   2+ |
----

The empty line on line 2 (shown in green with `+`) represents the trailing newline character.

=== Unicode character differences

.Detecting Unicode differences
[source,ruby]
----
it "detects non-breaking space vs regular space" do
  actual = "Hello World"
  expected = "Hello\u00A0World"  # Non-breaking space

  expect(actual).not_to be_string_equivalent_to(expected)
end
----

When this test fails, the output includes a Unicode legend:

----
expected STRING to be equivalent

Character Visualization Legend:
  ░ = U+0020 (Space)
  ␣ = U+00A0 (Non-breaking space)

Line-by-line diff (STRING mode):
   1|   1- | Hello░World
    |   1+ | Hello␣World
----

=== Multi-line string differences

.Comparing multi-line strings
[source,ruby]
----
it "shows line-by-line diff for multi-line strings" do
  actual = <<~TEXT
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
  TEXT

  expected = <<~TEXT
    Line 1
    Line 2 Modified
    Line 3
  TEXT

  expect(actual).not_to be_string_equivalent_to(expected)
end
----

Output shows context around the changed line:

----
expected STRING to be equivalent

Line-by-line diff (STRING mode):
   1|   1  | Line 1
   2|   2- | Line 2
    |   2+ | Line 2 Modified
   3|   3  | Line 3
----

== Usage in CLI

=== Comparing string files

.Using the diff command
[source,bash]
----
canon diff actual.txt expected.txt --format string
----

.Output
----
Line-by-line diff (STRING mode):
   1|   1  | Hello World
   2|   2- | Line with spaces
    |   2+ | Line with  spaces
   3|   3  | Final line
----

=== Format auto-detection

If you don't specify `--format`, Canon will auto-detect the format based on file content:

[source,bash]
----
canon diff actual.txt expected.txt
# Auto-detects as string if content isn't XML/JSON/YAML
----

== Usage in API

=== Using DiffFormatter directly

.Programmatic string comparison
[source,ruby]
----
require 'canon/diff_formatter'

actual = "Hello World"
expected = "Hello  World"  # Two spaces

formatter = Canon::DiffFormatter.new(
  use_color: true,
  mode: :by_line,
  context_lines: 3
)

diff = formatter.format([], :string,
                        doc1: actual,
                        doc2: expected)
puts diff
----

.Output
----
Line-by-line diff (STRING mode):
   1|   1- | Hello░World
    |   1+ | Hello░░World
----

=== Using Canon.format for canonicalization

Note: For strings, Canon does not perform canonicalization (no formatting changes are applied). The string is compared exactly as-is.

.String comparison example
[source,ruby]
----
require 'canon'

actual = "Hello World"
expected = "Hello World"

# Strings are compared as-is (no canonicalization)
result = Canon.format(actual, :string)
# => "Hello World"

result == expected  # => true
----

== Configuration

=== Customizing character visualization

You can customize how characters are visualized by configuring the visualization map:

.Customizing character map
[source,ruby]
----
Canon::RSpecMatchers.configure do |config|
  config.use_color = true
  config.context_lines = 3
  config.diff_mode = :by_line
end
----

=== Color output

Color output is enabled by default in RSpec. To disable:

.Disabling colors
[source,ruby]
----
Canon::RSpecMatchers.configure do |config|
  config.use_color = false
end
----

== Advanced Features

=== Trailing newline detection

Canon properly handles trailing newlines by preserving them during line splitting. This ensures that strings like:

* `"text"` (no trailing newline)
* `"text\n"` (with trailing newline)

Are shown as different, with the trailing newline visualized as an empty line in the diff output.

=== Context lines

By default, Canon shows 3 lines of context around changes. This can be configured:

.Adjusting context lines
[source,ruby]
----
Canon::RSpecMatchers.configure do |config|
  config.context_lines = 5  # Show 5 lines of context
end
----

== Technical Implementation

=== Line splitting

Canon uses `split("\n", -1)` to preserve trailing empty strings, ensuring that:

[source,ruby]
----
"abc\n".split("\n", -1)  # => ["abc", ""]
"abc".split("\n", -1)     # => ["abc"]
----

This allows proper detection and visualization of trailing newlines.

=== Character visualization map

The character visualization is configurable via `lib/canon/diff_formatter/character_map.yml`. See link:VISUALIZATION_MAP[Visualization Map Documentation] for details on customizing character representations.
